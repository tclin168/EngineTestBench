# EngineTestBench
Speed measurement, Cycle Time and Direction recognition

Topic: Applications of optical sensors on a PLC-based engine test bench for speed
measurement and direction recognition

Tasks:
• Built a voltage divider circuit, soldered the optical sensors on the engine test bench
and measured the output PWM (Pulse width modulation) displayed on oscilloscope

• Calculated the motor speed, cycle time, direction detection
